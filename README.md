Assume your role as GDG local community organizer and slide your leader fingers to left or right to take significant decisions about events and the local community you belong to.
Honor your assistants and build trustworthy relationships with sponsors and speakers. Be careful, every decision you take might leave you to any path!

Every level will gain into complexity as an organizer but also will enlighten hidden lessons about GDG organization issues.
